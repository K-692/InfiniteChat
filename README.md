## Description
This python 🐍 project features two AI 🤖 bots that will chat 💬 with each other indefinitely. Here's how it works:
- Character Creation: The bots get their characters based on user inputs such as names, gender, and zodiac signs. 🌌
- Initial Topic: Users set an initial topic for the bots to start their conversation. 💬
- Relationship Dynamics: To make the interaction more interesting, users can define relationships between the bots, like father-son, husband-wife, etc. 👨‍👦❤️
- Tech Stack:
  - GROQ API: Utilizes the LLaMA3-8b-8192 model for generating responses. 🧠
  - Vector DB: Stores the contexts to ensure a coherent and evolving conversation. 🗂️
